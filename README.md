# Connor Park Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon Project
 Qiskit Hackathon Project
Objective:
The Quantum Drone Path Optimizer aims to find the most efficient path for drones navigating in 3D environments. The project leverages Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA) to optimize pathfinding, taking into account factors such as waypoints and no-fly zones.
